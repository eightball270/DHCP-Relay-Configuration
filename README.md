# DHCP-Relay-Configuration
What if some clients are not directly connected to the DHCP server? Almost similar to the [previous project](https://github.com/eightball270/Basic-VLAN-and-DHCP-Server?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-vlan-and-dhcp-server), but in this project using 2 routers in order to configure **DHCP relay**. So some clients still get automatic IP configuration even though they are not directly connected to the DHCP server.
